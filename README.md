# RFID Smart Pet Feeder

Welcome to the **RFID Smart Pet Feeder** project! This is an intelligent pet feeding device designed to automate and personalize the feeding process for your pets. The system uses RFID technology to restrict access to food, ensuring that only authorized pets can eat from the feeder. It also includes a mobile app for remote control and monitoring.

## Features

- **Mobile App**: Configure feeding schedules, monitor food levels, and receive notifications via the iOS app.
- **Customizable Feeding Plans**: Set specific feeding times and portion sizes for each pet.
